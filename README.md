# Multi-view Generalised Kernel Machines

This repository contains Python code used to implement methodologies and reproduce results in _Hogan, J. and Adams, Niall M., Multi-view Generalised Kernel Machines for Regression, Classification and Outlier Detection_.

The MVGKM method is implemented in the `mvglm_algo.py` module. The implementation depends on and is designed to be compatible with the [scikit-multimodallearn] package. 
The `uWave`, `LibriCount` and `MVSA` directories contain the data pre-processing, cross-validation and results analysis scripts used to produce the results in the paper.
